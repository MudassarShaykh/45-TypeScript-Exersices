// Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magician’s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified

let magiciansNames:string[] = ["Teller", "David Blaine", "Dynamo", "Harry Potter"];

function make_great(magiciansArray:string[]) {

    for(let m = 0; m < magiciansArray.length; m++){

     magiciansNames[m] = "The great " + magiciansArray[m]
    }
}

function show_magicians(magician:string[]){

    for(let show of magician){
        console.log(show);
    }

};

make_great(magiciansNames);

show_magicians(magiciansNames);
